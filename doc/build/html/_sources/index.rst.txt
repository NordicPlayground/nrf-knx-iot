Welcome to nRF Connect SDK â€“ KNX IoT Point API
#################################################

KNX IoT extends the capabilities of the KNX standard with the power and flexibility of the Internet of Things (IoT). It allows KNX devices to be integrated with other IoT devices and cloud-based services, enabling the creation of advanced smart building systems.

With KNX IoT, devices can communicate over IP networks, allowing for greater flexibility in how devices are connected and controlled.

KNX-IoT consists of three core components:

  * KNX IoT 3rd Party API that enables data interoperability
  * Semantic information model to describe KNX installations and support devices interoperability
  * KNX IoT Point API that enables IPv6 and Thread based connectivity


This documentation provides instructions on how to correctly setup KNX Point API stack from the perspective of the `nRF Connect SDK`_. You can browse the contend by referring to the following pages:
